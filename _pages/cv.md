Research Projects
======

During my master's program, I primarily focused on magmatic-hydrothermal related ore deposits, such as Sn-W-Nb-Ta. For my PhD, I will concentrate on the evolution of early earth, especially the field in the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), Banded Iron Formation (BIF) mineralization, and the economic mineralization occurred in Collision orogenic belt.

The topics are as follows:

* Signal in carbon isotope to record the Lomagundiâ€“Jatuli Event (LJE) in North China Craton. (in progress)
* How to make collisional molybdenum deposits? (in progress)
* Rare metal mineralization in southern Great Xing'an Range, NE China (completed)
